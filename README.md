# LLM---Detect-AI-Generated-Text

Here are the steps we took for this project:

Data Collection:
Collect a large dataset of both AI-generated text and human-written text. This can include texts from different AI models (e.g., GPT-3, GPT-4) and various sources of human-written content.

Preprocessing:
Clean the text data by removing any noise, unnecessary punctuation, and formatting issues.
Tokenize the text into words or subwords depending on the model you plan to use.
Normalize the text by converting it to lowercase and handling any special characters or tokens.

Feature Engineering:
Extract features that might help distinguish AI-generated text from human-written text. These features can include:
Lexical features (e.g., word frequency, vocabulary richness).
Syntactic features (e.g., sentence length, grammar complexity).
Semantic features (e.g., coherence, topical relevance).

Model Selection:
Choose a model that is suitable for text classification tasks. Options include:
Traditional machine learning models like Logistic Regression, SVM, or Random Forest.
Deep learning models like LSTM, GRU, or Transformer-based models.
Pre-trained language models like BERT, RoBERTa, or a fine-tuned GPT model.

Training the Model:
Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.
Train the selected model on the training set and validate it on the validation set.
Use appropriate loss functions and metrics to evaluate model performance.

Evaluation:
Test the trained model on the test set to evaluate its accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Analyze any misclassifications to understand the model’s weaknesses.

Deployment:
Deploy the trained model as an API or integrate it into an application where it can be used to detect AI-generated text in real-time.
Ensure that the model can handle new and unseen text efficiently.

Monitoring and Updating:
Continuously monitor the model’s performance and update it with new data to maintain its accuracy over time.
